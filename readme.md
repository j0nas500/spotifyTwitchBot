## Disclaimer
I want to make this extremely clear, it is down to yourself to seek permission with the relevant providers (Spotify and Twitch) for more information and to determine whether you have the relevant licenses and/or permissions to play Spotify music on your stream. I accept no reliability or responsibility for any action either vendor may take,  you do so at your own risk.
