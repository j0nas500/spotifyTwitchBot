# Skip Spotify Song
This action reads the current song from the Spotify application and knows if a song is currently playing for skipping or if Spotify is paused or not open. If this is the case, the points are automatically refunded.

If Spotify is playing a song, then a C# program is used to press the media key to skip the song. The points are then automatically considered redeemed

## How to Install
Copy the string of the [skipSong](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/j0nas500/spotifyTwitchBot/master/actions/skipSong/skipSong?token=GHSAT0AAAAAABYHXQWEJSZKJDJJKKBZ7S52Y2BRCLA) File and import it into Streamer.Bot
